# Portfolio Project

### Reasoning
The portfolio project is a work-in-progress app designed to showcase myself and projects completed
as part of the Udacity Front End Web Developer Nano Degree. It is written using HTML5 and CSS (nothing fancy) , and is
fully responsive for desktop, tablet and phone screen sizes. It uses media queries to refactor the
interface as the screen size changes.

### Functionality

Currently there are three tabs. Home, portfolio and blog. The portfolio tab showcase various working projects and incorporates 
links to the github repositories.
